namespace DiceFight.V2.Model;

// v3 "Dice Kingdom" addition (2026-09-03). A Champion is NOT a card: it
// has no DieDefinition (CardDef.Die is non-nullable - there is genuinely
// no way to express a die-less source through CardDef), is never fielded,
// never purchased, never costs anything. It is a single passive that is
// simply always true for whichever player picked it, for the whole game.
//
// Every continuous effect in the closed vocabulary (StatAura,
// CostModifier, ...) is compiled by ContinuousRegistry and gated through
// ActiveSourceDice - a real DieInstance of some card, fielded/attacking.
// A Champion has no such die, so it is registered separately by
// ChampionRegistry directly into GameState's existing modifier lists,
// with AppliesTo checking the die/payer's OWNER instead of any source
// die's activity. QueryEngine's stat/cost queries need no changes at all
// - they already sum over those same lists.
//
// Deliberately a closed enum of four passive kinds, not a general
// mini-DSL - "dumb flat delta," the exact philosophy IDieStatModifier's
// own doc comment states for every other modifier in this engine. Extend
// only when a real fifth Champion needs a shape these four don't cover.
