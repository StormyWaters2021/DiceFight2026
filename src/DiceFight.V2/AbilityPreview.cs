// any of the following conditions: (1) there would be no result or
// potential result that changes the game state; (2) there are no legal
// targets available" (2.6.4.6 applies it to Action dice). The interpreter
// already FIZZLES an effect with nothing to act on at resolution; this is
// the up-front half, for abilities a player chooses to initiate (a Global,
// using an Action die) - so a Resurrection Global can't be paid for with
// nothing left to draw (user, 2026-09-28). Triggered abilities (Mountain
// Goat's On Attack draw) are NOT gated by this: the die still attacks and
// the draw just fizzles.
//
// Deliberately permissive: anything it can't cheaply judge counts as
// "could have a result", so this only ever rules out the clear cases
// (an empty draw, a target filter matching nothing).
