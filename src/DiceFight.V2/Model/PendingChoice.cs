// needs - target selection with a real choice, MayPay yes/no, DrawAndChooseOne
// - creates one of these and stops; GameState.PendingChoice being non-null
// is itself the "paused" signal (nothing else drains the queue further
// until it's answered - see EffectInterpreter.DrainQueue). Resolve is a
// closure captured at creation time (same "pass a closure to finish later"
// seam v1's own PendingChoice used) that validates the answer against
// Min/MaxCount, applies whatever the choice was for, clears
// GameState.PendingChoice, and resumes the rest of the effect tree that
// was waiting on it.
