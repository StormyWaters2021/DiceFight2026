// Rebuilds a recorded game by running its actions, in order, through the

// recorded seed. `onAction` sees the state BEFORE each action - the moment
// the player decided - which is what tuning and bot-teaching need ("what
// would the bot have done here?"). Each action's checksum is compared to
// the recording; the first mismatch is reported (an engine change since
// the game was played can do that) and the replay stops there.
